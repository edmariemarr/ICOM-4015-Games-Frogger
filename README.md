# Java-ICOM4015-Games-Frogger

This is a version of Frogger made by UPRM students.

For the class we had to improve on many aspects of the game with a partner.

My contributions:
1. Game score
2. Turtle reversal
3. No spawning on water
4. Collision of the frog with the trees

Partner contributions:
1. No overlap of logs and loop in right direction
2. Random # of lily pads appear in x axis
3. Fixed upper boundary
4. Created left and right boundaries

Incomplete due to problems with implementing game over screen.
Will attempt to finish.
